    "# Figure 2: Experiment 1, Neuroimaging Temporal Phase ($\\sigma_{\\phi}$),\n",
    "This notebook is used to recreate Figure 2, showing the temporal phase [$\\sigma_{\\phi}$] results for the neuroimaging data in Experiment 1. The data acquired has the following dimensions:\n",
    " 1. X = 128\n",
    " 2. Y = 100\n",
    " 3. Slices = 6\n",
    " 4. Diffusion directions [b=0 + $G_x$, $G_y$, $G_z$] = 4\n",
    " 5. Repetitions = 5\n",
    " 6. Trigger Delays = 8\n",
    "\n",
    "A user can selcet the volunteer, slice, and diffusion direction, and trigger-delay to then compute the temporal phase for a given grouping of images (Fig. 2A). The user can also select the slice and diffusion direction to plot the mean temporal phase variation across the 8 different trigger delay times (Fig. 2B). These are the same steps that are used to create Supplementary Figures 1 & 2. \n",
    "\n",
    "The last portion of the code shows heatmaps so a user can test signifiance between different different motion compensation levels for different trigger-delay times. "

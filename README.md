# About
This repository provides example code to accompany the manuscript "Phase Stabilization with Motion Compensated Diffusion
Weighted Imaging" (https://doi.org/10.1002/mrm.30218)

# Overview
The repository is divided into 2 sections: (1) Interactive Figures and (2) Manuscript Figures. Interactive Figures provide more self-guided interactive 
tools to recreate the manuscript figures while the latter folder contains the original code used to generate the figures used in the manuscript. 

## Dependencies
Anaconda enviornment was used to create Code in VSCode. Jupyter notebook could also be displayed natively in Jupyter Notebook environments. A user can start from any section of a notebook 
and have a figure window pop up on their computer, where they are able to customize the volunteer, slices, diffusion directions, and timepoints being shown. This code is self-contained and the 
Anacodona environment in this repository can be used with the appropriate installed package versions to execute the code. 


## 1. Interactive Figures

This folder has code for creating interactive figures using the brain and cardiac data used in the manuscript. Note that data paths in the notebooks will have to be changed to where the data is stored on a user's computer. 

## 2. Manuscript 

This folder contains code used to generate figures in the manuscript and is organized by experiment.
